## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2 
This lab was my favorite because it set the layout for the following labs. Base on the fact that every lab that came after had bits of the last lab that was done.

* Lab 5
 This lab gave me a bit of stress because i could not fix the errors that I had. It showed me whats to come and to better prepare my self for the up and coming labs. 
 
* Lab 8 
This one was my all time favorite due the second part. The black jack game was fun to make and play. I did have issues with it but ended up over coming with my partner help. Best lab overall!
